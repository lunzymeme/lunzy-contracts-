# Lunzy (LNZ) — Next-Generation ERC20 Token

Lunzy is not just another ERC20 token. It is a meticulously engineered digital asset that combines advanced tokenomics, community-driven incentives, and automated on-chain mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.

## Key Features

- **Total Supply:** 5,000,000,000,000 LNZ  
- **Automatic Taxation:** Every transfer applies a strategic allocation:
  - 2% → Marketing Wallet (supports growth and community engagement)
  - 1% → LUNC Burn Wallet (drives scarcity and long-term value)
  - 1% → Liquidity Wallet (strengthens trading depth and stability)
  - 1% → Auto-burn (deflationary mechanism enhancing token scarcity)

- **PinkLock Integration:** Transfers to/from PinkLock address bypass taxation for smooth partner & influencer operations.  

- **Transparent & On-Chain:** All tax, burn, and liquidity operations are executed on-chain, fully verifiable via the Ethereum network.

## Technical Overview

Lunzy leverages OpenZeppelin's battle-tested ERC20 framework, ensuring security, standard compliance, and upgradeability. Its `_update` function has been carefully overridden to implement real-time taxation, burn, and liquidity logic without compromising the core ERC20 functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/` : Contains Lunzy.sol, the main smart contract.  
- `scripts/`   : Optional deployment scripts (e.g., using ethers.js).  
- `tests/`     : Optional unit tests for functionality verification.  

## Vision

Lunzy represents the next evolution in community-centric crypto tokens. With automatic tokenomics, transparent on-chain operations, and strategic burn mechanisms, it is designed to reward long-term holders, enhance liquidity, and create a sustainable ecosystem that grows alongside its community.
